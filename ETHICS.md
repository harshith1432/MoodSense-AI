# 🔒 Ethical Guidelines & Privacy Policy

## MoodSense AI Ethical Statement

### Our Mission

MoodSense AI is designed to **improve emotional awareness and communication**, not to manipulate, surveil, or replace human empathy. This tool exists to help people understand emotional dynamics better and communicate more effectively.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Consent is Mandatory**

- ✅ **Webcam/Microphone Access**: Users must explicitly grant permission before any facial or voice analysis
- ✅ **Clear Indicators**: Visual/audio indicators show when analysis is active
- ✅ **Opt-Out Anytime**: Users can stop any analysis at any time
- ✅ **Informed Consent**: Users are clearly informed about what data is being analyzed

### 2. **Privacy First**

- 🔒 **No Default Storage**: Images and audio are **not stored** by default
- 🔒 **Temporary Processing**: Uploaded files are deleted immediately after analysis (unless explicitly saved)
- 🔒 **Local Processing**: Where possible, processing happens locally
- 🔒 **No Third-Party Sharing**: Your data is never shared with third parties
- 🔒 **Secure Database**: Analysis results stored securely in encrypted PostgreSQL

### 3. **Transparency**

- 📖 **Open About Limitations**: We clearly communicate what the system can and cannot do
- 📖 **Explainable AI**: Results include confidence scores and explanations
- 📖 **Source Attribution**: We credit the AI models and datasets used
- 📖 **Open Source**: Code is available for review and audit

### 4. **User Autonomy**

- 👤 **Your Data, Your Control**: Users own their data and can delete it anytime
- 👤 **No Manipulation**: The system provides guidance, not commands
- 👤 **Context Awareness**: We encourage users to apply judgment, not blindly follow suggestions
- 👤 **Empowerment**: The goal is to help users make better decisions themselves
